Requesting a certificate for vestagirls.online and www.vestagirls.online

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: nginx). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: vestagirls.online
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 2a02:4780:27:1369:0:37ae:89bf:9: Invalid response from http://vestagirls.online/.well-known/acme-challenge/efQtqSX48C88uZTbG4ifXdrAwpL6BWngyqQNAKBbo30: 404

  Domain: www.vestagirls.online
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 2a02:4780:27:1369:0:37ae:89bf:9: Invalid response from http://www.vestagirls.online/.well-known/acme-challenge/VybmM2LuPqWdHaL3-c-Pja37IYkT7-nY5PjSYuUURuo: 404

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary nginx configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure the listed domains point to this nginx server and that it is accessible from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
